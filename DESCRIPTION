Title: Combining Multiple Rank Sum Statistics
Version: 0.2.0
Author: David Kim
Maintainer: David Kim <davidk9@illinois.edu>
Description: Randomization inference for quantiles of individual treatment
    effects using combined rank sum statistics. Supports both completely
    randomized experiments (CRE) and stratified randomized experiments (SRE).
    For SRE, optimization is performed using either the open-source HiGHS
    solver (recommended, install with install.packages("highs")) or optionally
    the commercial Gurobi solver (requires separate license and installation).
