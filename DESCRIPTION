Title: Combining Multiple Rank Sum Statistics
Version: 0.2.0
Description: Randomization inference for quantiles of individual treatment
    effects using combined rank sum statistics. Supports both completely
    randomized experiments (CRE) and stratified randomized experiments (SRE).
    The optimization can be performed using either the open-source HiGHS solver
    or the commercial Gurobi solver.
