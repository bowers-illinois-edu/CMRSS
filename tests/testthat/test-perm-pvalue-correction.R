# The problem in CMRSS.  `pval_comb_block` computes
#
#     pval <- mean(stat.null >= stat.min)
#
# at R/CMRSS_SRE.R:54 and :71.  `stat.null` holds `null.max` draws from the
# reference distribution, so this is the proportion of draws at least as
# extreme as the observed statistic.  When no draw reaches `stat.min` the
# result is exactly 0, which claims a p-value smaller than the simulation
# can resolve.  Phipson and Smyth show that substituting such an unbiased
# estimator for the exact p-value inflates the type I error rate, and that
# adding one to both numerator and denominator does not.
#
# Why the corrected form is valid here.  Under H_{k,c}^treat the quantity
# tilde_t(Z, Y - Z*xi) has exactly the reference distribution, because the
# reference distribution is distribution-free (main.tex Theorem at line 900:
# G depends on the design and the scores, not on the outcomes).  The
# statistic CMRSS actually compares against it, `stat.min`, is a minimum
# over the null set and so is no larger than that quantity.  The observed
# value is therefore stochastically no larger than a draw, and counting it
# among the draws gives a p-value that is valid and, if anything,
# conservative.
#
# These tests describe a helper that does not exist yet.  They skip until
# it does.  See PLAN.md item 4A: wiring the correction into
# `pval_comb_block` changes every p-value by roughly 1/null.max, which is a
# numerical-output change and waits on the R&R replication run.
