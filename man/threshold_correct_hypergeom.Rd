\usage{
threshold_correct_hypergeom(
  N = 100,
  n = 50,
  K.vec = c(60, 80),
  alpha = 0.05,
  ndraw = 10^4,
  hg.draw = NULL,
  tol = 10^(-2)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{N}{Population size.}

\item{n}{Sample size.}

\item{K.vec}{Vector of quantile ranks in the population.}

\item{alpha}{Significance level.}

\item{ndraw}{Number of draws for Monte Carlo approximation.}

\item{hg.draw}{Optional pre-computed hypergeometric draws.}

\item{tol}{Tolerance for bisection search.}
}
\value{
A list with:
\item{kappa}{The correction factor}
\item{prob}{The resulting probability}
\item{kk.vec}{The adjusted sample quantile ranks}
}
\description{
Calculates the correction term Delta using the proposed choice of kk.vec
for generalizing inference to larger populations.
