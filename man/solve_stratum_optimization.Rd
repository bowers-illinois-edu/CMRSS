\title{Unified solver wrapper for stratum-level optimization}
\usage{
solve_stratum_optimization(coeflist, p, exact = TRUE, solver = "auto")
}
\arguments{
\item{coeflist}{A list of B matrices containing the stratum-wise
standardized test statistics for different coverage scenarios.}

\item{p}{Upper bound on the number of units with effects greater than c.}

\item{exact}{Logical; if TRUE, solve as integer linear program (ILP).
If FALSE, solve as linear program (LP relaxation).}

\item{solver}{Character string specifying the solver to use: "auto",
"highs", or "gurobi".}
}
\value{
A list with:
\item{sol}{Solution vector}
\item{obj}{Optimal objective value}
\item{solver}{The solver that was used}
}
\description{
A unified interface for solving the stratum-level optimization problem
using either Gurobi or HiGHS solver.
