\title{Electric Circuits Professional Development Study Data}
\format{
A data frame with 233 rows and 7 variables:
\describe{
\item{Site}{Character. Study site identifier (S2-S8). The experiment was
conducted across 7 sites.}
\item{T.ID}{Numeric. Unique teacher identifier.}
\item{Tx}{Character. Treatment group assignment with four levels:
\itemize{
\item A: Treatment condition A
\item B: Treatment condition B
\item C: Treatment condition C
\item D: Control condition
}}
\item{TxAny}{Numeric. Binary indicator for any treatment (1) vs control (0).
Teachers in groups A, B, or C have TxAny=1; teachers in group D have TxAny=0.}
\item{Per.1}{Numeric. Pre-test score (percentage correct, 0-100).}
\item{Per.2}{Numeric. Post-test score (percentage correct, 0-100).}
\item{gain}{Numeric. Gain score calculated as Per.2 - Per.1.}

\description{
Data from a randomized experiment studying the effects of professional
development on elementary teachers' science teaching, specifically related
to teaching about electric circuits.
}
\details{
This dataset comes from a study of professional development programs for
elementary science teachers. Teachers were randomly assigned to different
professional development conditions within each site (stratified randomized
experiment). The outcome measures assess teachers' content knowledge about
electric circuits before and after the intervention.

The dataset can be used to demonstrate methods for inference about quantiles
of individual treatment effects in stratified randomized experiments using
the CMRSS package.

##### Example 1: CRE Analysis (ignoring site stratification) #####

# Define Stephenson statistics with different s values
s.vec <- c(2, 6, 10, 30)
methods.list.cre <- lapply(s.vec, function(s) {
  list(name = "Stephenson", s = s, std = TRUE, scale = TRUE)
})

# Confidence intervals for effect quantiles among treated
ci.treat <- com_conf_quant_larger_cre(Z, Y,
                                      methods.list = methods.list.cre,
                                      nperm = 10000,
                                      set = "treat",
                                      alpha = 0.05)

##### Example 2: SRE Analysis (accounting for site stratification) #####

s <- length(levels(block))  # 7 sites

# Define polynomial rank statistics for each stratum
r.vec <- c(2, 6, 10)
methods.list.sre <- list()
for (j in seq_along(r.vec)) {
  methods.list.sre[[j]] <- lapply(1:s, function(i) {
    list(name = "Polynomial", r = r.vec[j], std = TRUE, scale = FALSE)
  })
}

# Confidence intervals accounting for stratification
ci.treat.sre <- com_block_conf_quant_larger(Z, Y, block,
                                            set = "treat",
                                            methods.list.all = methods.list.sre,
                                            weight.name = "asymp.opt",
