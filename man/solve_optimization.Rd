\usage{
solve_optimization(
  Z,
  block,
  weight,
  coeflists,
  p,
  ms_list,
  exact = TRUE,
  block.sum = NULL,
  solver = "auto"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{Z}{An n-dimensional treatment assignment vector.}

\item{block}{An n-dimensional vector specifying block of each unit.}

\item{weight}{A B-dimensional vector of block weights.}

\item{coeflists}{A list of H elements, each containing B matrices with
block-specific test statistics for different values of k.}

\item{p}{Upper bound on the number of units with effects greater than c.}

\item{ms_list}{A list containing mu (means) and sigma (standard deviations)
for each test statistic.}

\item{exact}{Logical; if TRUE, solve as integer linear program (ILP).
If FALSE, solve as linear program (LP relaxation).}

\item{block.sum}{Optional pre-computed block summary from summary_block().}

\item{solver}{Character string specifying the solver to use. Options are:
\itemize{
\item "auto": Automatically select available solver (default)
\item "highs": Use HiGHS solver (open-source)
\item "gurobi": Use Gurobi solver (commercial, requires license)
}}
}
\value{
A list with:
\item{sol}{Solution vector}
\item{obj}{Optimal objective value}
\item{solver}{The solver that was used}
}
\description{
A unified interface for solving the optimization problem using either
Gurobi or HiGHS solver.
}
\details{
This function provides a unified interface for both solvers. When solver = "auto",
it will prefer HiGHS if available (as it's open-source), otherwise fall back to Gurobi.

Both solvers produce equivalent results for the same optimization problem,
though there may be minor numerical differences (typically < 1e-6) due to
different internal algorithms.

\dontrun{
# Automatically select solver
result <- solve_optimization(Z, block, weight, coeflists, p, ms_list)

# Explicitly use HiGHS
result <- solve_optimization(Z, block, weight, coeflists, p, ms_list, solver = "highs")

# Explicitly use Gurobi
result <- solve_optimization(Z, block, weight, coeflists, p, ms_list, solver = "gurobi")
