\usage{
correct_hypergeom(
  N = 100,
  n = 50,
  K.vec = c(60, 80),
  kk.vec = c(30, 40),
  ndraw = 10^4,
  hg.draw = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{N}{Population size.}

\item{n}{Sample size.}

\item{K.vec}{Vector of quantile ranks in the population.}

\item{kk.vec}{Vector of corresponding sample quantile ranks.}

\item{ndraw}{Number of draws for Monte Carlo approximation.}

\item{hg.draw}{Optional pre-computed hypergeometric draws.}
}
\value{
Probability value for the correction.
}
\description{
Computes the correction term based on the multivariate hypergeometric
distribution for generalizing inference to larger populations.
