\title{Optimization function using Gurobi solver (original implementation)}
\usage{
Gurobi_sol_com(
  Z,
  block,
  weight,
  coeflists,
  p,
  ms_list,
  exact = TRUE,
  block.sum = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{Z}{An n-dimensional treatment assignment vector.}

\item{block}{An n-dimensional vector specifying block of each unit.}

\item{weight}{A B-dimensional vector of block weights.}

\item{coeflists}{A list of H elements, each containing B matrices with
block-specific test statistics for different values of k.}

\item{p}{Upper bound on the number of units with effects greater than c.}

\item{ms_list}{A list containing mu (means) and sigma (standard deviations)
for each test statistic.}

\item{exact}{Logical; if TRUE, solve as integer linear program (ILP).
If FALSE, solve as linear program (LP relaxation).}

\item{block.sum}{Optional pre-computed block summary from summary_block().}
}
\value{
A list with:
\item{sol}{Solution vector}
\item{obj}{Optimal objective value}
}
\description{
Solves the integer/linear programming problem for computing the minimum test
statistic in stratified randomized experiments using the Gurobi solver.
}
\details{
This is the original Gurobi-based implementation. For users without a Gurobi
license, \code{\link{HiGHS_sol_com}} provides equivalent functionality using
the open-source HiGHS solver.
