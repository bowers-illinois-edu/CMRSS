\description{
Solves the integer/linear programming problem for computing the minimum test
statistic in stratified randomized experiments using the HiGHS solver.
}
\details{
This function formulates and solves an optimization problem to find the
minimum value of the combined test statistic under the constraint that
at most p units have effects greater than a threshold c.

The problem has the following structure:
\itemize{
\item Variables: x_sj (binary/continuous), eta_h, theta
\item Objective: minimize theta
\item Constraints: probability constraints per stratum, coverage constraint,
test statistic equality constraints, and normalization constraints
}

\examples{
\dontrun{
# This is typically called internally by pval_comb_block()
# Direct usage requires pre-computed coefficient lists
