  Z,
  Y,
  block,
  k.vec = NULL,
  methods.list.all,
  weight.name = "asymp.opt",

}
\arguments{
\item{Z}{An \eqn{n} dimensional treatment assignment vector.}

\item{Y}{An \eqn{n} dimensional observed outcome vector.}

\item{block}{An \eqn{n} dimensional vector specifying block of each
units.}

\item{k.vec}{Optional vector of specific quantile indices to compute.
If NULL, computes for all quantiles.}

\item{methods.list.all}{A list of lists of lists. Corresponds to the
method for each stratum for each different stratified rank sum
statistic.}

\item{weight.name}{Weighting method to be implemented. If
"asymp.opt", asymptotically optimal scheme under a class of local
alternatives is adjusted, if "dist.free", design-free scheme is
adjusted.}

\item{opt.method}{Optimization method. Options include:
\itemize{
\item "ILP_gurobi": Integer linear programming with Gurobi solver
\item "LP_gurobi": Linear programming relaxation with Gurobi solver
\item "ILP_highs": Integer linear programming with HiGHS solver (open-source)
\item "LP_highs": Linear programming relaxation with HiGHS solver
\item "ILP" or "ILP_auto": Integer LP with auto-selected solver
\item "LP" or "LP_auto": Linear programming with auto-selected solver
}
HiGHS is recommended for users without a Gurobi license. Both solvers
produce equivalent results.}

\item{comb.method}{Integer specifying the combination method:
\itemize{
\item 1: Combine statistics across strata first, then take maximum across methods (default)
\item 2: Take maximum across methods within each stratum first, then combine across strata
}}

\item{stat.null}{An vector whose empirical distribution
approximates the randomization distribution of the combined
stratified rank sum statistic.}

\item{null.max}{A positive integer representing the number of
permutations for approximating the randomization distribution of
the rank sum statistic.}

\item{tol}{Tolerance for root-finding algorithm.}

\item{alpha}{Significance level for confidence intervals.}
}
\value{
Vector of lower confidence limits for the specified quantiles.
}
\description{
Output is a lower limit of prediction intervals for prespecified quantiles.
