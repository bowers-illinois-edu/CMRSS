\title{Solver Utilities for CMRSS Package}
\usage{
solver_available(solver)
}
\arguments{
\item{solver}{Character string: "gurobi" or "highs"}
}
\value{
Logical indicating if the solver is available
}
\description{
The package supports two optimization solvers:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Gurobi}: Commercial solver (requires license). Fast and robust.
\item \strong{HiGHS}: Open-source solver. No license required, good performance.
}

Both solvers produce equivalent results for the same optimization problem.
HiGHS is recommended for users without a Gurobi license.
Check if a solver is available
}
\details{
This file contains optimization solver functions for solving the integer/linear
programming problems in stratified randomized experiments. It supports both
Gurobi and HiGHS solvers.
