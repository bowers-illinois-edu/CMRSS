# CMRSS: Combining Multiple Rank Sum Statistics

Randomization inference for quantiles of individual treatment effects
using combined rank sum statistics. Supports both completely randomized
experiments (CRE) and stratified randomized experiments (SRE). The
optimization can be performed using either the open-source HiGHS solver
or the commercial Gurobi solver.
