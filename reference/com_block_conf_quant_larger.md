# Simultaneous bound for confidence interval using combined rank sum statistic on stratified randomized experiment

Computes simultaneous confidence intervals for quantiles of individual
treatment effects in stratified randomized experiments.

## Usage

``` r
com_block_conf_quant_larger(
  Z,
  Y,
  block,
  set = "all",
  methods.list.all = NULL,
  weight.name = "asymp.opt",
  opt.method = "ILP_auto",
  comb.method = 1,
  stat.null = NULL,
  null.max = 10^4,
  Z.perm = NULL,
  tol = 0.01,
  alpha = 0.1
)
```

## Arguments

- Z:

  An \\n\\ dimensional treatment assignment vector.

- Y:

  An \\n\\ dimensional observed outcome vector.

- block:

  An \\n\\ dimensional vector specifying block of each unit.

- set:

  Set of quantiles of interest. Options:

  - "treat": Prediction intervals for effect quantiles among treated
    units

  - "control": Prediction intervals for effect quantiles among control
    units

  - "all": Confidence intervals for all effect quantiles

- methods.list.all:

  A list of lists of lists. Corresponds to the method for each stratum
  for each different stratified rank sum statistic.

- weight.name:

  Weighting method to be implemented. If "asymp.opt", asymptotically
  optimal scheme under a class of local alternatives is adjusted, if
  "dist.free", design-free scheme is adjusted.

- opt.method:

  Optimization method. Options include:

  - "ILP_gurobi": Integer linear programming with Gurobi solver

  - "LP_gurobi": Linear programming relaxation with Gurobi solver

  - "ILP_highs": Integer linear programming with HiGHS solver
    (open-source)

  - "LP_highs": Linear programming relaxation with HiGHS solver

  - "ILP" or "ILP_auto": Integer LP with auto-selected solver

  - "LP" or "LP_auto": Linear programming with auto-selected solver

  HiGHS is recommended for users without a Gurobi license. Both solvers
  produce equivalent results.

- comb.method:

  Integer specifying the combination method:

  - 1: Combine statistics across strata first, then take maximum across
    methods (default)

  - 2: Take maximum across methods within each stratum first, then
    combine across strata

- stat.null:

  An vector whose empirical distribution approximates the randomization
  distribution of the combined stratified rank sum statistic.

- null.max:

  A positive integer representing the number of permutations for
  approximating the randomization distribution of the rank sum
  statistic.

- Z.perm:

  Optional pre-computed n x null.max matrix of permuted treatment
  assignments. If provided, this matrix will be used instead of
  generating new permutations. Can be generated using
  `assign_block(summary_block(Z, block), null.max)`.

- tol:

  A numerical object specifying the precision of the obtained confidence
  intervals. For example, if tol = 10^(-3), then the confidence limits
  are precise up to 3 digits.

- alpha:

  A numerical object, where 1-alpha indicates the confidence level.

## Value

A vector specifying lower limits of prediction (confidence) intervals
for quantiles k = 1 ~ m (or n - m, or n).

``` r

    list(name = "Polynomial", r = r.vec[j], std = TRUE, scale = FALSE)
